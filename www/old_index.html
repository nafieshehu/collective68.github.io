  <h2>What is free software?</h2>
  <p><em><strong>Free software</strong></em> is about freedom&mdash;freedom from corporations who attempt to control their users and place a stanglehold on the internet. We&lsquo;re fighting against that.</p>
  <h3>Free software allows us to&hellip;</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Run the program for any purpose.</li>
    <li>Study how the program works, and change it to make it do what we wish.</li>
    <li>Redistribute and make copies so we can help our neighbors.</li>
    <li>Improve the program, and release our improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What&rsquo;s a collective?</h2>
  <p>Candlewaster is a collective. In short, this means that what we get out of it is proportional to what we put into it. We&rsquo;re a non-heirarchal team with equal standing that works together to solve problems and create a more free world.</p>
